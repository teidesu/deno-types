# deno-types

due to the lack of properly packaged Deno types for `tsc`, this repository tries to fill that gap
between the node.js ecosystem and the Deno runtime.

the package is updated automatically in ci, and should be up-to-date with the latest Deno release version.
if you notice something is missing, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## installation

the recommended way to install this is to install it under `@types/deno` alias,
by putting the following in your `package.json`:

```json
{
    "devDependencies": {
        "@types/deno": "npm:@teidesu/deno-types@latest"
    }
}
```

this way you can reference the types in your `tsconfig.json` like this (see below for more info):

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "types": ["deno/ns"]
    }
}
```

(without the above, you would need to put `@teidesu/deno-types` instead of `deno`)

## usage

generally, there are 2 ways to use this repository â€“ either using
pre-merged types, or referencing all bits and pieces manually.

### pre-merged types

we generate 3 different flavors of pre-merged types:

| flavor          | description                                                            | conflicts                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ns`            | only the `Deno` namespace, without any other types                     | none                                                    |
| `full`          | all Deno-specific APIs that are not available in core TypeScript types | `lib.dom.d.ts`, partially `@types/node`, `ns` flavor    |
| `free-standing` | `full`, but linked towards Deno's own builtin libs                     | overrides default types, `"noLib": true` should be used |

for most use-cases of mixing Node.js and Deno code, the `ns` flavor is the best choice, as it
the least amount of conflicts and links towards `tsc` built-in types. however it should be noted that
`ns` *may* lag behind some features, as it is only automatically updated to a certain extent.

to use a flavor, you can reference it in your `tsconfig.json` like this:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "types": ["deno/ns"]
    }
}
```

or using the `/// <reference types="deno/ns" />` directive in your TypeScript files.

### manual types

you can also reference the needed types manually. for a list of all available types,
the best way is to just look around in the installation directory (e.g. `node_modules/@types/deno`),
since the structure may change over time. for example, for Deno's `fetch` API, you would use the following:

```ts
// this one links towards typescript's built-in libs
/// <reference types="deno/ext_tslib/lib.deno.fetch" />

// this will link towards Deno's own libs
/// <reference types="deno/ext/lib.deno.fetch" />
```

## running the script

```bash
bun install
bun run src/main.ts --ref main
```
